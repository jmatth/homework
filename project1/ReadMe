All the allocator logic lives in the iloc module. Inside this module are two files:

  - __init__.py: contains the 3 main algorithms and some helper methods

  - instruction.py: contains class definitions to represent iloc instructions,
    registers, etc.


The executable file alloc is a driver that processes user input, checks it for
any errors, and invokes the specified algorithm from the iloc module. It takes
command-line arguments as specified in the project description. Since python is
an interpreted language, no compilation is necessary.
