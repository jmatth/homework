\begin{enumerate}
%Question 1
\item The Longest Common Prefix problem is defined as follows:

    {\bf Preprocess}: $D$ is a set of $n$ strings, each of which is
        length $m$.

    {\bf Queries}: $LCP(i,j)$ returns $k$ if $S_i[1...k] = S_j[1...k]$
        but $S_i[1...k+1] \neq S_j[1...k+1]$

Give an algorithm for this where the query time is constant.

%Question 2
\item Given a rooted tree $T$, define $T(v)$ to be the set of leaves in $T$
    below $v$. For a set of nodes $V'$, define $LCA_T(V')$ to be the shallowest
    node $u$ in $T$ such that $u = LCA(w,x)$, for $w$,$x \in V'$

    Given two rooted trees, $S$ and $T$ with the same leaf labels, define, for
    each node $v$ in $S$, $M(v) = LCA_T(S(v))$.

    Give an algorithm to compute $M$.
