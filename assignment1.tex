\begin{enumerate}
%Question 1
\item Prove: A binary tree with $n$ nodes has a depth at least $\lfloor
log(n) \rfloor$ and at most $n - 1$.

%Question 2
\item Prove that $log(n!) \in \Theta(nlogn)$


%Question 3
\item Prove by induction on $k$.


%Question 4
\item Place the following functions into increasing asymptotic order. If two
or more of the functions are of the same asymptotic order, then indicate this.
Prove the correctness of your ordering.
Functions: $4n, n^2, nlogn, nlnn, logn, e^n$

%Question 5
\item Let $G = (V,E,W)$ be a weighted graph such that no two different edges
in E have the same weight. Prove that $G$ has a unique unrooted minimal spanning
tree.

%Question 6
\item Using the method $HamC(G)$, which returns Yes if $G$ contains a
Hamiltonian Cycle, and No otherwise, construct an algorithm to compute
$HamP(G,u,v)$.

\end{enumerate}
