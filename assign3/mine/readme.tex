\section{Design}
The program prints the fibonacci sequence at the n$^{\textrm{th}}$ position, where n is an integer provided as an argument. The value is calculated by adding two values together n time in a loop.

\section{Efficiency}
The program runs one loop n times. The time efficiency is O(n). For space it uses five integers, one for the argument, on to control the loop, and three to perform the calculations.
