\begin{enumerate}

\item Question 1

    Same process could be used to find minimum product spanning tree since you
    need to
    remove the largest edges possible, as in the minimum spanning tree.
    Therefore, any minimum spanning tree is also a minimum product spanning
    tree.

\item Question 2

    a. Counterexample: any matrix that does not have 0s on the diagonal cannot
    fit this because the distance from a leaf to itself must be 0.

\item Question 3

    a. This is true because as long as the distances between two nodes does not
    need to be an integer, then you can add any number of internal nodes to
    create any set of distances between them.

    b. There are 3 cases that can occur here:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $i$ is above or at the same level as $j$ and $k$
        \item $j$ is above or at the same level as $i$ and $k$
        \item $k$ is above or at the same level as $j$ and $i$
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
